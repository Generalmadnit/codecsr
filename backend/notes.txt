1. Encapsulation:

code which can process the data into a single programming unit and prove the only way to access the data
if not operations directly on data (by without having enough knowledge) may cause to inconsistency of the object

how to?
+ variables with private/degault access
+ methods with public

(if the .java is new than the .class file then the jvm compiles it and then updates the )
