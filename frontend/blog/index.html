            <h3>How do they look</h3>
            <p>Storm clouds appear black or gray from below because little to no sunlight penetrates them. If you were to look at them from above, they would appear white because the sun illuminates that side.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row-child">
            <h3>How do they form</h3>
            <p>Storm clouds form when water vapor in the air becomes saturated and clumps together into raindrops. This leaves larger spaces between the water drops, which means less light is reflected.</p>

            <h3>How do they look</h3>
            <p>More commonly known as thunderclouds, cumulonimbus is the only cloud type that can produce hail, thunder and lightning. The base of the cloud is often flat, with a very dark wall-like feature hanging underneath, and may only lie a few hundred feet above the Earth's surface.</p>

            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>"Storm clouds" refers to the dark, dense, and towering clouds typically associated with thunderstorms, heavy rain, lightning, and sometimes severe weather phenomena like tornadoes or hail. These clouds often have a menacing appearance, characterized by their dark gray color and turbulent formations. They indicate atmospheric instability and the potential for precipitation and severe weather events.</p>
