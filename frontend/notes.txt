To learn abous css animations you must follow the below properties:
- @keyframes
- animation-name
- animation-duraiton
- animation-delay
- animation-iteration-count
- animation-direction
- animation-timing-function
- animation-fill-mode

@Keyframes Rule
- when you specify CSS styles inside the @Keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the 
new style at certain times.
- To get animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element
